### Troubleshooting Notes
```
When installing these packages, make sure you are in the vue-starter-project directory. If you install them under this directory, and it still is having package issues, install the packages in the distribution packages folder on your machine manually using a command like the following:
```
pip install <package name> --target /path/to/dist-package/folder/
```
The distribution package folder is found in this file path on LINUX:
```
cd /usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
